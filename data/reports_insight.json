    "title": "Japan: Finding Opportunity Across Sectors",
    "date": "2023-07-20",
    "insights": "Japan's economy is showing signs of positive growth with a shift in its nominal GDP path after years of stagnation. This change is expected to benefit both workers and companies, improve fiscal sustainability, and have a positive impact on asset prices, including equities. The Bank of Japan is likely to adjust its yield curve control program, allowing more fluctuations in ten-year JGB yields while maintaining its short-term policy rate. Structural reforms in industries like AI, IT, energy, health care, and education are driving progress, with significant momentum expected in the next 2 to 3 years. These developments suggest potential investment opportunities in Japanese equities and industries undergoing transformative changes. However, it's essential to monitor policy shifts and economic indicators closely to make informed portfolio decisions."

    "title": "The Inconvenient Truths About EV Batteries",
    "date": "2023-06-01",
    "insights": "The global electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chain presents challenges with high environmental externalities and reliance on China. Morgan Stanley's analysis highlights a tradeoff between near-term EV penetration and on-shoring policies. They explore three scenarios: rapid EV adoption dependent on China, a derisking case with a more diversified supply chain, and a slow EV case focused on on-shoring. To succeed in the rewired battery supply chain, firms should prioritize cost-efficient and sustainable technologies in strategic regions. Investors should consider the impact of EV adoption rates and supply chain sourcing when making financial decisions in their portfolios."
